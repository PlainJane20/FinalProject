Background
Since the digital camera was invented, people stop to choose a perfect location, pose, frame to make a photo. Digital cameras, especially phone cameras, give us the ability to take as much photo as we can or want. 

Motivation 

With the amount of photos people take with their cameras/phones, and image file sizes increasing; people need to categorize their photos that may be extremely similar and have the option of keeping or deleting them. This can save time organizing photographs or deleting unwanted photographs, instead of paying to upload their extra photos or upgrading their memory storage. 


Questions to answer

How much space is taken from unwanted photos?
Behavior of taking photos by location
How often photos are taken by time, day & month
Category type of photos taken (landscape, selfie, food)

Tools/Modules to use
Tensorflow & Tensorflow Hub
Numpy
Python
Javascript
HTML/CSS/bootstrap
Leaflet
Google API ???
